## Introduction

This document simulates the spread of a disease where each infected person infects a random number of new people (0, 1, 2, or 3) with equal probability. The simulation tracks the number of infections over time and visualizes the results.

## Setup

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

simulate_disease_spread <- function(initial_infecteds = 1, max_generations = 10) {
  set.seed(123) # For reproducibility
  
  # Initialize data frame to store results
  results <- data.frame(Generation = integer(),
                        Infected = integer())
  
  current_generation <- 1
  current_infected <- initial_infecteds
  
  while (current_generation <= max_generations) {
    # Append current results
    results <- rbind(results, data.frame(Generation = current_generation,
                                         Infected = current_infected))
    
    # Calculate new infections
    new_infected <- 0
    for (i in 1:current_infected) {
      num_infected <- sample(0:3, 1) # Randomly choose 0, 1, 2, or 3
      new_infected <- new_infected + num_infected
    }
    
    # Update the number of infected for the next generation
    current_infected <- new_infected
    current_generation <- current_generation + 1
  }
  
  return(results)
}

# Parameters
initial_infecteds <- 1
max_generations <- 10

# Run simulation
simulation_results <- simulate_disease_spread(initial_infecteds, max_generations)

# Print results
print(simulation_results)

ggplot(simulation_results, aes(x = Generation, y = Infected)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Disease Spread Simulation",
       x = "Generation",
       y = "Number of Infected Individuals") +
