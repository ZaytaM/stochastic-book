Source files of "Lecture notes for Intro to Stochastic Processes", University of Texas at Austin. The rendered book is at [gordanz.github.io/M362M](https://gordanz.github.io/M362M).

These notes are written in Rmarkdown. Core examples/simulations are written in R/tidyverse. Examples and graphs in the Markov Chains section and later are (mostly) produced using the R package *chapman* available at CRAN or at [gordanz/chapman](https://github.com/gordanz/chapman).
