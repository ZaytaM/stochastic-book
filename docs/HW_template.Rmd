## Problem 1.1

This is where I would explain what I am doing. 

### a.

```{r}
1/238746238746
```

You can write an explanation here, too. 

### b.

```{r}
2^45
```

### e.

```{r}
cos(pi/8)
```
  

## Problem 1.2

### 3.

```{r}
(A = matrix(c(1, 2, -1, 3), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE))
```


## Problem 1.3.

### 2.

```{r}
my_function <- function(x) { 
  if (2 < x & x < 3) {
    return(TRUE)
  } else {
    return(FALSE)
  }
}
```

If the problem asked for a plot, you would do it in a "chunk", too (don't worry about the specifics of the commands used below)

```{r}
x = seq(from = 0, to = 12*pi, length = 500)
y = sin(x)
plot(x,y , type = "l", col = "red", lwd = 2, lty = "dashed")
```
