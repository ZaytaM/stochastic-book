            <h3>Course info</h3>
            <p><strong>Course Description.</strong> M362M is an undergraduate course on stochastic processes and applications. We focus on several classes of elementary stochastic processes which are often used in various applications such as random walks, discrete Markov chains and, time permitting, the Poisson process and Brownian motion. The course will promote the generative approach to probability and the use of computer simulations.</p>
            <p><strong>Learning Objectives.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Students will get acquainted with mathematical tools and techniques, as well as the probabilistic intuition necessary for understanding and successful use of stochastic models in a variety of applications within mathematics and in science, engineering, economics, etc. They will also learn how to build new models, in yet-unencountered situations and novel frameworks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Students will become familiar with the basics of the programming language R and the RStudio IDE. They will learn how to use R to simulate random variables and stochastic processes. Those skills will allow them to answer a much wider spectrum of questions about the behavior of stochastic processes, compared to a purely analytic approach.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Prerequisites.</strong> The formal prerequisits are the grade B or better in M362K and a grade of at least C- in 340L or 341 with a grade of at least C-.</p>
            <p>Students are assumed to be at home with the basics of probability as presented in, e.g., Ross&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Ross-First-Course-in-Probability-A-10th-Edition/PGM1786065.html">First Course in Probability</a>, Pitman&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387979748">Probability</a> or Asimow and Maxwell&rsquo;s <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Probability_and_Statistics_with_Applicat.html?id=ZL3QQZsp6DAC">Probability and Statistics with Applications</a>; there will be a brief review. Also, a good working knowledge of calculus - especially sequences and series - is assumed; no review will be given.</p>
            <p>Students are not assumed to have any prior programming experience and the basics of R will be covered from scratch.</p>
            <p><strong>Textbook.</strong> There is no required textbook. Lecture notes written by the instructor will be posted online at <a class="uri" href="https://zaytam.github.io/stochastic-book">https://ZaytaM.github.io/Stochastic-Book</a>. The students in need of an additional source of problems (or explanation) are referred to the following books:</p>

                    <p>The course-management system <strong>Canvas</strong> will be used in this course to keep track of grades, serve as a repository of links to other resources and to relay various announcements. The students are responsible for the contents of these announcements. The easiest way not to miss any is to turn on (i.e.&nbsp;not turn off) <em>Announcements</em> in their account&rsquo;s <em>Notification</em> menu.</p>

                    <p>This term we will be using <strong>Discord</strong> for class discussion (Invite: https://discord.gg/hdBdeKXw3J). The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the instructor, I encourage you to post your questions on there. I will moderate discussions, and any abuse or harassment will not be tolerated.</p>

            <h3>Assessment and grading</h3>
            <p><strong>Homework assignments.</strong> A weekly or bi-weekly homework will be assigned (with the assignments posted on Canvas). The submission will be <strong>electronic</strong>, through Canvas. Detailed instructions on the proper format of your submissions will be posted in due time (we need to cover a little bit of R before that). Submit well before the deadline - the system has been known to get &ldquo;overwhelmed&rdquo; close to it. If everything else fails, send your file(s) directly to the instructor (before the deadline!) with a detailed explanation of the difficulties you experienced. Late hw will not be accepted.</p>
            <p>You are allowed (and, in fact, encouraged) to work on your homework in groups of up to 4 people, and to submit a single document per group. Do not forget to include the names of all group members. Two lowest hw scores will be dropped.</p>
            <p><strong>Exams.</strong> There will be three in-term exams and no separate final exam. All exams will be "in class" with &ldquo;open-notes&rdquo; and will consist of a mix of theoretical and programming questions, done in a written setting. The schedule is as follows:</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                <li><strong>In-term 1</strong> : Sep 26</li>
                <li><strong>In-term 2</strong> : Oct 29</li>
                <li><strong>In-term 3</strong> : Dec 05</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Dropping a midterm:</strong> If it helps, the HW average will replace the lowest midterm score.</p>
            <p>If you miss an exam <em>for a documented reason</em> (illness, approved and previously announced religious holiday, or some other extraordinary circumstance), make-up arrangements will be made on a case-by-case basis.</p>
            <p><strong>Final grade.</strong> The final grade is composed as follows:</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr class="header">
                        <th>Assignment</th>
                        <th>Percentage of final grade</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr class="odd">
                        <td>Homework</td>
                        <td>40%</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr class="even">
                        <td>Exams</td>
                        <td>60%&nbsp;(20% each)</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>The class will be completely <em>curved</em>. More specifically, your relative rank in the class will determine your final grade.</p>

            <p><strong>Drop dates.</strong> The procedure/consequences are different, depending on whether you drop before or after the 12th day of classes (09/11), and then, before or after the <em>main drop (Q-drop) date</em> (11/20).

            <p><strong>Students with Disabilities.</strong> The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. If you have a documented disability and you need specific support as a result of your disability, please let me know as soon as possible, but definitely within the first 3 weeks of class.

            <p><strong>Religious holy days.</strong> Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. Sections 51.911 and 51.925 of the Texas Education Code relate to absences by students and instructors for observance of religious holy days.</p>
            <p>Section 51.911 states that a student who misses an examination, work assignment, or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day must be given an opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence, provided that they have properly notified each instructor.</p>
            <p>It is the policy of The University of Texas at Austin that the student must notify each instructor at least fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled on dates he or she will be absent to observe a religious holy day. For religious holidays that fall within the first two weeks of the semester, the notice should be given on the first day of the semester. The student may not be penalized for these excused absences but the instructor may appropriately respond if the student fails to complete satisfactorily the missed assignment or examination within a reasonable time after the excused absence.</p>
            <p><strong>Title IX Reporting/SB 212.</strong> Texas <em>Senate Bill 212</em> requires all employees of Texas universities, including faculty, report any information to the <a href="https://titleix.utexas.edu/">Title IX Office</a> regarding sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking that is disclosed to them.
